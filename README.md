# mmWave-ray-tracer-dataset
Data for simulating channel at mmWave frequencies with some mobility in Downtown Roslyn, VA.

The detailed simulation setup will all parameters can be found here https://github.com/shastpi/mmWave-ray-tracer-dataset/blob/main/SimSetup/SimulationSetup.pdf


Similar simulation setup was used in https://www.techrxiv.org/articles/preprint/Multi-cell_Multi-beam_Prediction_using_Auto-encoder_LSTM_for_mmWave_systems/17695394

The final dataset is stored in a .mat file here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1avSrpWQwtj1HVNMdOrcnaBie1Uahvt9R/view?usp=sharing .
