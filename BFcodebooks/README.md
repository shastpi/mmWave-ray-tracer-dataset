Beamforming codebook antenna patterns for BS and UE.

BS has 64 codewords in its codebook. UE has 8 codewords in its codebook.

BS codewords antenna pattern is in the MATLAB file PatternsTX.mat. The mat file contains 3 dimensional tensor. 1st dimension is codeword idx = 1:64, Second dimension is Azimuth angle from 0:180. Angle zero correpsonds to idx 1 of azimuth. Third dimension is Elevation angle from -90 :90. Angle -90 correpsonds to idx 1 of elevation.


UE codewords antenna pattern is in the MATLAB file PatternsRX.mat.  The mat file contains 3 dimensional tensor. 1st dimension is codeword idx = 1:8, Second dimension is Azimuth angle from 0:180. Angle zero correpsonds to idx 1 of azimuth. Third dimension is Elevation angle from -90 :90. Angle -90 correpsonds to idx 1 of elevation.
