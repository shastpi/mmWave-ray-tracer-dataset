Adding mobility on top of the ray-tracer generated traces using binary occupancy grid and MATLAB robot navigation toolbox.

The algorithm used for generating mobility is Rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT)

The  binary occupancy grid can be found in mymap.mat. The file contains a map object which can be used for navigation. Each entry of binary occupancy grid is a 1 x 1 m^2 measurement area
